Install it and run:

```
npm install
dev:
npm run dev
build:
npm run build

```
After executing the export commond, you can see the exported HTML content on a directory called "out" inside your project.

If you want to continue testing the app, install the following serve NPM module globally:
```
npm install serve -g
```

After you've installed "serve", run following commands from the app root:
```
cd out
serve -p 8888<port number>
```
